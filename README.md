# Irrigation-Web-App for Lethbridge College

Created during an internship with Lethbridge College, Mueller Research Group with self-taught material. Incorrect formatting and coding practices may have been utilized. 

The goal for this project was to create a web app that replicated this Earth Engine Code Editor app created by me: https://code.earthengine.google.com/0da90e0ad7d615c2892c2cf9462afcae (can only be run by users who have access to the Earth Engine)
Limitations to the EE Code Editor app include:
  - Drawing new polygons while the program is running will not process Kc, ETc data for the new polygon. Requires the program to run again after a polygon is drawn.
  - Saving polygons in the app is not possible as there is no database to save the polygons and the users.
    o However, users can save the app into their own script and it will keep record of the polygons they draw assuming that they save the script after each polygon drawn.


Please read the "Irrigation Web App Documentation" for further details about the project.
